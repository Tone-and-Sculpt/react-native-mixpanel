- [iOS] Update SDK to 3.6.2 (https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone/releases/tag/v3.6.2)
- [iOS] Remove IFA/IDFA - Removing using IFA as distinct id. Beginning with this version, Mixpanel no longer uses the IFA(ID for Advertisers) but uses a randomly generated UUID as the default distinct ID instead. After you call reset, Mixpanel generates a new distinct_id by default. This ensures that multiple users on the same device are not assigned the same alias. If you want to use IFV(identifierForVendor) as the distinct_id, you can set MIXPANEL_UNIQUE_DISTINCT_ID=1 in build settings Preprocessor Macros on the Mixpanel framework target. After you call reset, the IFV will not change. However, when a user removes and then re-installs the app, the IFV will change with each installation.
